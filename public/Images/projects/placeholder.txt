# Project Images Placeholder

This folder contains project images. You can add your actual project screenshots here:

- job-portal.jpg - Screenshot of your Job Portal application
- wegive.jpg - Screenshot of your WeGive donation platform
- portfolio.jpg - Screenshot of this portfolio website

For now, the portfolio will use placeholder images. To add real images:
1. Add your project screenshots to this folder
2. Name them exactly as referenced in the code:
   - job-portal.jpg
   - wegive.jpg
   - portfolio.jpg
3. The images will automatically appear in the portfolio

Recommended image size: 400x250 pixels for best display
